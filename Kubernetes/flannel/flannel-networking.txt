For this example, flannel assigns an address range of 10.20.0.0/16 to be used by all nodes in the Kubernetes environment. This allow a separate /24 subnets within that range to be assigned to network interfaces on the master and both nodes. For the three systems in this example, the steps below resulted in the following address ranges being assigned to flannel.1 and docker0 interfaces:

master:
flannel.1: 10.20.21.0/16
node1:
flannel.1: 10.20.26.0/16
docker0: 10.20.26.1/24
node2:
flannel.1: 10.20.37.0/16
docker0: 10.20.37.1/24

Steps
on master
etcdctl set coreos.com/network/config < flannel-config.json
etcdctl get coreos.com/network/config

on master and nodes
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/flanneld
# Flanneld configuration options

# etcd url location.  Point this to the server where etcd runs
FLANNEL_ETCD="<master-ip>:4001"

# etcd config key.  This is the configuration key that flannel queries
# For address range assignment
FLANNEL_ETCD_KEY="/coreos.com/network"

# Any additional options that you want to pass
#FLANNEL_OPTIONS=""


restart service

sudo systemctl restart flanneld
sudo systemctl enable flanneld
sudo systemctl status flanneld -l
